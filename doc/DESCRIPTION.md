This is a fork of Iceshrimp's Masto-FE Standalone repository, which is itself a fork of Mastodon Glitch Edition, which in turn forks Mastodon. Phew!

The goal of this fork is to make it possible to smoothly and intuitively use the Mastodon frontend with a GoToSocial instance as the backend.

This mostly means making changes to the frontend to allow it to work with GoToSocial-specific features, making it slightly less Mastodon-y by changing some of the branding, wording, iconography, etc, and fixing other small issues.

The application doesn't gather or store any information that you give it, including access tokens or passwords, everything just happens in your browser's local storage.
